<h2>harbour bridge</h2>
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the world’s most recognisable landmarks. Not only is it the largest steel arch bridge on the planet, but it also spans one of the globe’s finest natural harbours. Affectionately named the Coathanger by locals, it’s an intrinsic part of the city; you can walk or cycle across it and even climb to its peak for incredible views.
